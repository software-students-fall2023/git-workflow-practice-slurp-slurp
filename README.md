# Git Practice 
In this assignment, you will familiarize yourself with two common version control workflows using git and GitHub: a centralized workflow; and a forking workflow (also known as the "open source workflow").

## Centralized Workflow

### Article: CS vs. SWE

### What I find interesting
It is interesting for me to see a direct comparison between computer science and software engineering. After reading the article, I find computer science more theoretical than I have experienced as a major. As described, computer scientists do not necessarily need to be good at coding - their study can be very abstract, focusing on fundamental philosophies and mathematical principles. Of course, professional research would be more concentrated, but it is still much more abstract than things in my undergraduate studies, such as web development and data management. In the meantime, I find software engineering more comprehensive than I imagined. While I understood it to be a practical field, it is interesting for me to learn that coding, or building the software,  is not the only or that big of a part in it. Instead, testing codes, deploying codes, and even teamwork are all parts of software engineering. The end goal is to deliver a useful and functional product to the client, which is essential in the industry.

## Forking Workflow

### Comments by Jeffrey Chen
I think this is a very interesting take and I agree!  As a computer science student, I often feel the disconnect between the curriculum-required courses and what people do in SWE jobs.  Thankfully for elective courses like Agile and AIT, I was able to do some work that I believe is more in tune with what SWEs do in the professional field.  -Jeffrey Chen

### What I (Charles Hu / comeom) finds interesting
Diving into the Stack Overflow article felt like slurping a delicious vegetable juice from the local bodega for 6.99. Computer Science is akin to understanding the nutritional value, vitamins, and benefits of each vegetable in the mix. It's about knowing why kale pairs well with cucumber or why ginger gives that zesty kick. In contrast, Software Engineering is the act of blending those veggies into a refreshing juice, ensuring the flavors balance just right for that perfect sip. Just as you trust your local bodega to craft a juice worth every cent of the $6.99, in the tech world, it's about blending knowledge and application to create something both insightful and practical. Cheers to a well-blended tech journey! ðŸ¥¤ðŸŒ¿
